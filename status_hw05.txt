Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Ben Wakefield


2. What hostname did you deploy to?
hw05.wenbakefield.com


3. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
I had trouble converting my JavaScript code for the game logic
to Elixir, but I was able to use my Fundies 1 notes and HexDocs
on anonymous and higher-order functions in order to get proper
results.


4. What part of your application state is on the server?
All state and game logic is handled on the server.


5. What part of your application state, if any, is in the browser?
The input for each guess is handled in the browser.
The browser also receives past guesses and whether or not the user
has won or lost. The input box and submit button are locked by the
browser, but it is also handled in the server, and the player will
receive a warning message if they try to edit the HTML to make
more guesses.
